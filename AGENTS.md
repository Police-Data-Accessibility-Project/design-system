# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Source lives in `src/`, with UI broken into `components/`, cross-cutting utilities in `utils/`, Tailwind-powered tokens and mixins under `styles/`, and demo scaffolding in `demo/` (used by `npm run dev`). Image and font assets sit in `src/assets/` and are emitted to `dist/` alongside the compiled library entry points referenced by `package.json` exports. Docs for each component live in `docs/` and feed the autogenerated index produced by `npm run docs`. The `eslint-config/` workspace contains the shared lint rules that consuming apps extend.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` — launches the Vite playground so you can interactively verify component changes.
- `npm run build` / `npm run build:watch` — produce the distributable bundle plus type declarations (watch rebuilds on change).
- `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:es`, `npm run lint:css`, `npm run typecheck` — run the Vue/TS ESLint rules, Stylelint over CSS-in-Vue, and `vue-tsc` structural checks; all must pass before merging.
- `npm run test`, `npm run test:changed` — execute the Vitest suite with coverage or limit runs to files touched locally; CI executes `npm run test:ci`.
- `npm run docs` — refresh `docs/components.md` after adding or moving component guides.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Components are Vue 3 composition-API + TypeScript; use PascalCase for component directories/files (`PdapHeader.vue`) and camelCase for helpers. The repo favors tab indentation (see `src/components/Header/PdapHeader.vue`) and enforces formatting with Prettier and ESLint via `@pdap-design-system/eslint-config`. Keep styles in `<style>` blocks leveraging Tailwind `@apply`, and colocate component READMEs that describe props and usage. Lint-staged plus Husky run the relevant linters pre-commit, so fix warnings before pushing.

## Testing Guidelines
Vitest with the Happy DOM environment backs both unit and snapshot tests (`*.spec.ts` collocated with components, utility tests such as `src/utils/breadcrumbs.test.ts`). Name suites after the component under test and prefer factory helpers so specs stay deterministic. Always run `npm run test` (or at least `test:changed`) before opening a PR; coverage reports land in `coverage/` and are auto-cleaned by `posttest`. Add snapshots when altering markup, and update them intentionally with `vitest -u`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Create topic branches prefixed by intent (e.g., `feature/add-stepper`, `fix/Button-border`). Use `npm run _commit` (Commitizen) to craft Conventional Commits so semantic-release can version automatically; commits are linted via Husky hooks. Pull requests should describe the motivation, link any GitHub issues, and attach screenshots or screen recordings for visual tweaks. Confirm `lint`, `test`, and `build` all pass locally, and mention any docs updates (`npm run docs`) in the PR body. Tag reviewers on Discord if feedback is needed, and prefer small, focused changes to keep release automation predictable.
